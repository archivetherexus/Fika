# Purpose
The `re` directory contains all the code that is within the `re` namespace.  
The purpose of the `re` namespace is to contain the reflections library of Fika.  
The name `re` is short for `reflections` as one could easily guess, and while the use
of abbreviations for names is genuinely discouraged, we use an abbreviation here for
the following reasions:
* This namespace is for internal usage primarily, and for external usage secondarly.
* This namespace is used so commonly through out the project that the code size decrease
  outweighs the negative aspects of abbreviations.
* You can easily understand from the context that this has to do with reflections.
